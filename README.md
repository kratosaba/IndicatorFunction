In this work, we propose to tackle the reconstruction of 3D objects from cross-
sections with the help of deep learning, focusing on a approach driven by data.
Typically, such techniques are used to learn high-level features of 2D images, where
their applications range from classification, segmentation to point cloud reconstruc-
tion.
